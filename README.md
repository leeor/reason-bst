# ReasonML Binary Tree Challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to exercise some of the basics of ReasonML. Specifically, here are
the elements that will be practiced:

1. Types
1. Recursion
1. Lists
1. Generic types

## Getting Started

1. Clone and run `npm i`
1. Run `npm run watch` to build automatically on file change
1. Run `npm run test:watch` to run the tests after each build

## The Challenge

1. Implement the contents of `src/IntTree.re` to satisfy the `IntTree` tests
1. Implement the contents of `src/GenericTree.re` to satisfy the `GenericTree` tests
1. Implement `IntTree` using `GenericTree`
